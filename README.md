# A Python Program / Project

**This is a Python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the sixth semester class Bioinformatics
and is one of the final projects for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A python script that implements an efficient algorithm for the Chimeric Alignment problem. A virus infects a bacterium and modifies a replication process in the bacterium by adding for each A an A sequence of length 1-5, for each C a C sequence of length 1-10, for each G a G sequence of length >= 1 and for each T a T sequence of length >= 1.
